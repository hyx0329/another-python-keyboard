# Overall module design

- Keyboard
    - Process key status and transform to events, propagate to HIDDevice
        - can be recognized as a middle ware
    - HIDDeviceWrapper(General)
        - BLE
        - USB
        - for everything above, IO and signal handlers
    - BoardClass(Device specific, hardware definition)
        - Keys(how to get key events)
            - Matrix style
            - Per-IO
            - Interrupt
            - Whatever
            - API
                - scan subroutine
                - get key(current status)
        - Leds(Or, indicators, whatever, appearance)
